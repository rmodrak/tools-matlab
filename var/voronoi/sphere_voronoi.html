      SPHERE_VORONOI <br> Voronoi Diagram of Points on the Unit Sphere
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_VORONOI</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      computes the Voronoi diagram of points on the unit sphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Steven Fortune, it is possible to compute the Delaunay triangulation
      of points on a sphere by computing their convex hull.  If the sphere is the unit
      sphere at the origin, the facet normals are the Voronoi vertices.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_VORONOI</b> uses this approach, by calling MATLAB's <b>convhulln</b>
      function to generate the convex hull.  The information defining the convex hull
      is actually the Delaunay triangulation of the points.  From here, it is possible
      to compute the Voronoi vertices, and to determine how these vertices are
      joined to form the Voronoi polygons.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code, as presented here, is quite preliminary.  In particular, the process
      of converting the Delaunay information into information about the Voronoi polygons
      is inefficient.  I suspect, though, that I can compute the centroids almost
      immediately, without having to go through the tedious process of determining
      the ordering of the Voronoi vertices that constitute each Voronoi polygon.
      If I can clear that up, then it should be possible to apply this simple algorithm
      to systems with hundreds of points.
